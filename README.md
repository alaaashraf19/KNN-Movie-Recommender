# KNN-Movie-Recommender

This project implements a simple movie recommendation system using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and the MovieLens 100K dataset. It recommends movies to users based on the preferences of similar users.


## Dataset

This project uses the [MovieLens 100K Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) which contains 100,000 ratings from 943 users on 1,682 movies.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Due to licensing, the dataset is **not included** in this repository. Please download it from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and place it in the `data/` directory.

## Features

- Loads and explores the MovieLens dataset using Pandas
- Builds a User-Item Interaction Matrix
- Implements KNN using cosine similarity
- Recommends movies based on similar users
- Evaluates recommendations with Precision and Recall
- Visualizes similarity scores and recommendation performance

- ## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alaaashraf19/KNN-Movie-Recommender.git
   cd KNN-Movie-Recommender


## Evaluation

The recommendation system was evaluated using:

- **Precision**: Proportion of recommended movies that are relevant.
- **Recall**: Proportion of relevant movies that were recommended.

We tested different values of `k` to analyze the trade-offs.
